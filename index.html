      Hey, this site is being revamped! Almost all content has been moved to my new site
      <a href="https://codedaily.io">Code Daily</a>. This site will now serve as a personal blog focusing on where I want to take
      <a href="https://codedaily.io">Code Daily</a>, the things I'm trying, and how well it's going.
    </p>
    <p>It's my latest endeavor in creating educational content to make you a better developer. Don't fret, all my previous has
      been saved and moved over. I've provided links to everything that I felt was valuable enough to save and setup redirects
      on the previous URLs.</p>
